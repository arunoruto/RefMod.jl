  abstract = {A mathematically rigorous formalism is derived by which an arbitrary photometric function for the bidirectional reflectance of a smooth surface may be corrected to include effects of general macroscopic roughness. The correction involves only one arbitrary parameter, the mean slope angle θ, and is applicable to surfaces of any albedo. Using physically reasonable assumptions and mathematical approximations the correction expressions are evaluated analytically to second order in θ. The correction is applied to the bidirectional reflectance function of B. Hapke (1981, J. Geophys. Res. 86, 3039–3054). Expressions for both the differential and integral brightnesses are obtained. Photometric profiles on hypothetical smooth and rough planets of low and high albedo are shown to illustrate the effects of macroscopic roughness. The theory is applied to observations of Mercury and predicts the integral phase function, the apparent polar darkening, and the lack of limb brightness surge on the planet. The roughness-corrected bidirectional reflectance function is sufficiently simple that it can be conveniently evaluated on a programmable hand-held calculator.}

  abstract = {A model published previously by the author that describes light scattering from particulate media is modified to include several improvements: (1) a better approximation to the Ambartsumian–Chandrasekhar H-functions that is especially important for particles with single scattering albedos close to 1.00, (2) increased accuracy for anisotropically scattering particles, and (3) incorporation of coherent backscattering. The goal of the original model of being analytic and mathematically tractable is preserved. No new parameters are introduced by the first and second modifications; however, the third unavoidably adds two new parameters: the amplitude and width of the coherent backscatter opposition effect. Several examples are given in which the results of calculations using the original and new models are compared with exact numerical computations. It is shown that a medium composed of complex particles that are large compared to the wavelength can have a coherent backscatter opposition effect (CBOE) that is broad enough to be readily observable. The CBOE multiplies the entire reflectance and not just the multiply scattered component, so that a low-albedo medium, such as lunar regolith, can have a strong CBOE.}

  abstract = {A comparison of the photometric properties of Mercury and the Moon is performed, based on their integral phase curves and disk-resolved image data of Mercury obtained with the Swedish Vacuum Solar Telescope. Proper absolute calibration of integral V-band magnitude observations reveals that the near-side of the Moon is 10–15% brighter than average Mercury, and 0–5% brighter for the “bolometric” wavelength range 400–1000 nm. As shown, this is supported by recent estimates of their geometric albedos. Hapke photometric parameters of their surfaces are derived from identical approaches, allowing a contrasting study between their surface properties to be performed. Compared to the average near-side Moon, Mercury has a slightly lower single-scattering albedo, an opposition surge with smaller width and of marginally smaller amplitude, and a somewhat smoother surface with similar porosity. The width of the lobes of the single-particle scattering function are smaller for Mercury, and the backward scattering anisotropy is stronger. In terms of the double Henyey–Greenstein b–c parameter plot, the scattering properties of an average particle on Mercury is closer to the properties of lunar maria than highlands, indicating a higher density of internal scatterers than that of lunar particles. The photometric roughness of Mercury is well constrained by the recent study of Mallama et al. (2002, Icarus 155, 253–264) to a value of about 8°, suggesting that the surfaces sampled by the highest phase angle observations (Borealis, Susei, and Sobkou Planitia) are lunar mare-like in their textural properties. However, Mariner 10 disk brightness profiles obtained at intermediate phase angles indicate a surface roughness of about twice this value. The photometric parameters of the Moon are more difficult to constrain due to limited phase angle coverage, but the best Hapke fits are provided by rather small surface roughnesses. Better-calibrated, multiple-wavelength observations of the integral and disk-resolved brightnesses of both bodies, and obtained at higher phase angle values in the case of the Moon, are urgently needed to arrive at a more consistent picture of the contrasting light scattering properties of their surfaces.}
